# First Stage (Application)


## Job description

Are you interested in the history of Robotics and do you enjoy interacting with
the public?

As a Robots Engagement Volunteer you will be part of an enthusiastic and new team
supporting the museum's blockbuster exhibition Robots. This is a chance for you
to research and explore the innovative world of humanoid robotics and engage
visitors with the incredible objects on display.

Volunteers will be based inside the Robots exhibition delivering pop-up object
handling to families and adults alike, helping to encourage understanding by
sharing stories and knowledge.

This is a wonderful opportunity to gain experience of science communication in a
museum setting, contribute to our visitor's experience of the exhibition and
develop practical research skills. Most importantly, joining the team is a great
way to meet like minded individuals and have fun.

We'd love to hear from you and we wish you every success with your application.

Closing Date: 27th April 2017

## Application

* Why would you like to volunteer with the Robots exhibition?  

As a international scientist in the UK doing a PhD in Human-Robot Interaction,
I believe that volunteering in the Robots exhibition is a win-win situation
because of the following two reasons:
(I) my passion for robots began since I was a child (around six years old),
I remember that I was thrilled to destroy and build things. I always wanted
to know how things worked;
(II) my background is in Mechatronics Engineering and since 2014 I am trying
to push the frontiers of human-robot interaction which, I believe, is ideal
to answer any questions about humanoid robots.

I feel very lucky to have this opportunity to volunteer at the Science Museum
as I enjoy sharing general and specific knowledge regarding humanoid robots
to people of different backgrounds, ages and nationalities.


* What skills and experience do you think you could contribute to this role?  
I have been involved in different Open Days at University of Birmingham since 2014
in which I was promoting the different areas of engineering that are related to
robotics. Therefore, my skills of communication varies from explaining the
basic knowledge of how a robot works to the state-of-the-art algorithms that are
implemented in humanoid robots to understand the world.
My experience in designing workshop or robotics for children is
ideal to create engagement activities that can persuade children in their future
careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Additionally, I am Mexican which means that my mother tongue is Spanish,
that is one of the three languages (Mandarin and English included) with the
most native speakers in the world.


* Employment History  
Company name: University of Birmingham  
Date From (dd/mm/yyyy) 10/11/2014  
Date To (dd/mm/yyyy) 10/11/2018  
(80 character maximum)  

Job title: Doctoral Researcher in Human-Robot Interaction    

Please tell us about your key responsibilities and achievements (3,500 character maximum):  

As a Doctoral Researcher in Human-Robot Interaction at University of Birmingham,
During my two years and a half as a researcher, I have participated in an
international entrepreneurship program where I presented a low-cost robot prototype
that can provide education for free to children. I have also participated in different
Open Days where I engaged with young students (fifteen to twenty years old)
and by being enthusiastic where I encouraged them to study any area of engineering
related to robotics. I have also published works in three conferences and been
in two international conferences that give confidence to communicate with people
from different backgrounds, ages as well as nationalities.
Additionally, as part of my PhD, I am developing a workshop for children to learn
Robotics using very cheap robots that are based in fold-able robots, and I am
planning that this activity can be part of Outreach activities at University of
Birmingham.

# Second Stage (Taster Days)

 Robots Engagement Volunteer Taster Day on Saturday 6th May from 11.00-14.00

 Our Taster Days are an informal selection day, so please don’t dress up! The only
 thing that we ask of you is to bring an object that you think is amazing to discuss
 for our Show and Tell activity. We’ll ask each of you to chat for one minute,
 so keep it short and sweet! Bring something portable and easy to carry,
 if your object is your priceless grand piano, stick to a photograph instead!

## Show and Tell Activity

I did suppose that a "show and tell activity" was to create a little tale which
has the components of sweetness and briefness. However, I was wrong and a "show
and tell activity" is literally an activity where you bring an object and you
show it and tell and history about it to the audience.
Therefore, I only print a photo of robit and I speak about him as my friend and
show the part of robit (motors, wheels, raspberry pi, etc) and explain to my
audience that robot and I want to teach foreign languages to children for free
and also create positive emotions.

It turns out to be that
this sort of activity is very useful to develop the speaking and listening English
skills for children. More:

### FIRST DRAFT
```
"Doing Real Human-Humanoid Interaction"

H: Wow, Are you Robot?
R: Well, well...

H: That's very interesting, hahaha.
R: jijiji

H: I am super lucky to meet you. Believe it or not, you are one of my favourites robots.    
R: Really? This is like a destiny. I always wanted to meet a more advanced robot.

H: Wait, I am not a robot, am I?
R: One never knows, perhaps, you are one without even knowing the good combination
of hardware (body) and software (brain) of billion of years of evolution.

H: Really? How can you know?
R: Well, that is very easy to answer, the way you move,
the way you speak, your vision system. Basically, you are the first generation of
Robots.

H: Interesting, tell me more.
R: Actually, you human beings are a mystery for us. Humans in their early stage of
their life are very curious, very expressive, always exploring, always failing and
experimenting. They behave like well-know scientist.

### SECOND DRAFT
```
"Meeting Robit"

H: Wow, Are you Robit?
R: Yes, I am.

H: I am super lucky to meet you. Believe it or not, you are one of my favourites robots.    
R: Really? Wow! This is like a destiny. I always wanted to meet a very advanced robot.

H: Wait!, wait!, I am not a robot.  I am a human being.
R: One never knows, perhaps, you are a well evolved robot without even knowing
all the good combination of hardware (your body senses) and
software (your neural networks).


H: Really? How can you know?
R: Well, that is very easy to answer.
It is very interesting to observe the complexity of your behaviour.
WAIT, that's too boring, let's better play game?

H: Yeah, sure!
R: The game is simply "Guessing what I am doing?"

H: Right!
R: Let's start!
R: (Robit is showing how to hug a person)

H: Are you hugging me?
R: Yes! You are very clever.

R: I believe humans have to be positive about the future of robots.
I believe together we can create better conditions for a better world.
