## Application

* Why would you like to volunteer with the Robots exhibition?  
As a international scientist in the UK doing a PhD in ~~in the area of~~
Human-Robot Interaction ~~I want to be a better scientist, and~~
I believe that volunteering in the Robots exhibition is a win-win situation
because I am trying to pushing the frontiers of robotics using NAO (a humanoid robot)
and with this knowledge that I am gaining everyday is very valuable to
anyone who is intersted in robotics particularly in humanoid robots.
~~the new generation of scientist as well as the humanity to which I am happy to share~~
~~where, based on my experience of working with NAO (a humanoid robot)~~
~~I will therefore happily share my knowledge and experience related to humanoid robots.~~
 ~~with working with NAO.  On the other hand,~~
My passion for robots begin since I was a child, I was thrilled to destroy and
build things, I always wanted to know who things work. Therefore, at this stage
of my life I am doing research to help humanity using
~~and the area of~~
humanoids robots.
~~has given me much deeper questions as I am advancing.~~
I feel lucky to have this opportunity to volunteer at the Science Museum
becuase I am astonishing about the capability of humanoid robots as  well as
to enjoy to share knowledge.
~~By the way, I do love robots.~~
~~I love robots and I love science that make my lucky to live in this era and
certainly for the time being in the UK~~
~~One of the main reasons is that I do love robots and I believe in the idea of
sharing knowledge to humanity is one way to advance the frontiers of science.~~


* What skills and experience do you think you could contribute to this role?  
I have been involved in different Open Days at University of Birmingham where
I was promoting different areas of engineering related to robotics.
Therefore, my skill of communication varing from
proving to basic knowledge of the parts of the robots to the state-of-the-art
algorithms that are implemented to understand the outside world of the humanoid.
My experience in designing workshop or robotics for children is ideal to create
engagament activities that can persuate children for their future careers in
Science Technology EM?
~~I have the skills and the knowledge to promote robotics and also to show people
how humanoid robots are improving the life of humanity in different areas of
our society.~~
~~promote the use of NAO, an humanoid robot, to improve the life of people in
diverse areas of our society.~~
