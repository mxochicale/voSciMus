 Robots Engagement Volunteer
 ---

## Job description

Are you interested in the history of Robotics and do you enjoy interacting with
the public?

As a Robots Engagement Volunteer you will be part of an enthusiastic and new team
supporting the museum's blockbuster exhibition Robots. This is a chance for you
to research and explore the innovative world of humanoid robotics and engage
visitors with the incredible objects on display.

Volunteers will be based inside the Robots exhibition delivering pop-up object
handling to families and adults alike, helping to encourage understanding by
sharing stories and knowledge.

This is a wonderful opportunity to gain experience of science communication in a
museum setting, contribute to our visitor's experience of the exhibition and
develop practical research skills. Most importantly, joining the team is a great
way to meet like minded individuals and have fun.

We'd love to hear from you and we wish you every success with your application.

## Application

* Why would you like to volunteer with the Robots exhibition?  

As a international scientist in the UK doing a PhD in Human-Robot Interaction,
I believe that volunteering in the Robots exhibition is a win-win situation
because of the following two reasons:
(I) my passion for robots began since I was a child (around six years old),
I remember that I was thrilled to destroy and build things. I always wanted
to know how things worked;
(II) my background is in Mechatronics Engineering and since 2014 I am trying
to push the frontiers of human-robot interaction which, I believe, is ideal
to answer any questions about humanoid robots.

I feel very lucky to have this opportunity to volunteer at the Science Museum
as I enjoy sharing general and specific knowledge regarding humanoid robots
to people of different backgrounds, ages and nationalities.


* What skills and experience do you think you could contribute to this role?  
I have been involved in different Open Days at University of Birmingham since 2014
in which I was promoting the different areas of engineering that are related to
robotics. Therefore, my skills of communication varies from explaining the
basic knowledge of how a robot works to the state-of-the-art algorithms that are
implemented in humanoid robots to understand the world.
My experience in designing workshop or robotics for children is
ideal to create engagement activities that can persuade children in their future
careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Additionally, I am Mexican which means that my mother tongue is Spanish,
that is one of the three languages (Mandarin and English included) with the
most native speakers in the world.

Job title: Doctoral Researcher in Human-Robot Interaction    

Please tell us about your key responsibilities and achievements (3,500 character maximum):  

As a Doctoral Researcher in Human-Robot Interaction at University of Birmingham,
During my two years and a half as a researcher, I have participated in an
international entrepreneurship program where I presented a low-cost robot prototype
that can provide education for free to children. I have also participated in different
Open Days where I engaged with young students (fifteen to twenty years old)
and by being enthusiastic where I encouraged them to study any area of engineering
related to robotics. I have also published works in three conferences and been
in two international conferences that give confidence to communicate with people
from different backgrounds, ages as well as nationalities.
Additionally, as part of my PhD, I am developing a workshop for children to learn
Robotics using very cheap robots that are based in fold-able robots, and I am
planning that this activity can be part of Outreach activities at University of
Birmingham.
